# Basic-AI-ML-Projects-

Welcome to the Basic AI/ML Projects repository! This repository is created to host a collection of basic AI/ML projects where I practice and hone my skills in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find various Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) containing different AI/ML projects. Each project focuses on specific concepts and techniques, providing a hands-on learning experience.

## Projects Included
